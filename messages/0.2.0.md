# Aiguillon 0.2.0
## Improvements:
* Addition of missing expansion commands
* Completions now consider the package the caret is in.
* Indentation information is now stored (although not at all used, but the storage allows others to write code to use it).
* New option to ignore compilation errors and load anyway.
* Additional compilation status messages
* Performance boost by decreasing completion timeout 
* Ability to copy information from the debugger
## Bug fixes
* Use of bundled syntax by default (oops)
* Settings caching
* Spawn new REPLs in the current window, not the session window.
