# Albula 0.3.0
## You can now start an inferior lisp process directly in the REPL
To do this first set the lisp command in settings and then use the command 'Sly: Start and connect to an inferior lisp instance'.

If you disable autoclose then disconnected process will be kept alive, to close them use "Sly: Close orphaned inferior lisp instances".

## Bug fixes
* Fix completions not considering full symbol name
* Fix completions not considering correct package at REPL
* Improve status messages for session manager
* Fix syntactic misuse that causes errors in the latest version of ST.
